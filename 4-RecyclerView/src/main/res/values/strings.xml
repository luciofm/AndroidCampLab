        sound  (help·info)) is a 1,979-seat opera house, which was built from 1861 to 1875 for the
        Paris Opera. It was originally called the Salle des Capucines, because of its location on
        the Boulevard des Capucines in the 9th arrondissement of Paris, but soon became known as
        the Palais Garnier, in recognition of its opulence and its architect, Charles Garnier.
        The theatre is also often referred to as the Opéra Garnier (French About this sound
        (help·info)) and historically was known as the Opéra de Paris or simply the Opéra,[7] as
        it was the primary home of the Paris Opera and its associated Paris Opera Ballet until
        1989, when the Opéra Bastille opened at the Place de la Bastille.[8] The Paris Opera now
        mainly uses the Palais Garnier for ballet.
